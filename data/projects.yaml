  short-description:
    The recreation of a blog that had previously been made with Octopress.
    Using more modern technologies to implement a newer blog and updated informaion.
  long-description:
    This is just example text so I can see how things shape up using YAML and the layout I'm using.
    So I need to keep talking about stuff until I'm satisfied with the length of the text that
    will be appearing once you click on a specific project piece.
  technology: GatsbyJS, CSS Grid, SCSS
